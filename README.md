_Each program is designed to perform a specific task and provide a solution to a problem. All the programs are written in the C programming language and can be easily compiled and run on any system with a C compiler installed._

# How to Use?
To use any of the programs in this project, you will need to have a C compiler installed on your system. Once you have a compiler installed, simply download the source code for the program you wish to use, compile it, and run it.

For example, to use the Arithmetic Calculator program, follow these steps:

Step I: Download the arithmetic_calculator.c file from the project repository.<br>
Step II: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file was saved.<br>
Step III: Compile the program by running the command gcc arithmetic_calculator.c -o arithmetic_calculator.<br>
Step IV: Run the program by running the command ./arithmetic_calculator.<br>
Repeat the above steps for each program you wish to use.
